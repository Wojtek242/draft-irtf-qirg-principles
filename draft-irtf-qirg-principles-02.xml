   <abstract>
     <t>The vision of a quantum internet is to fundamentally enhance Internet
     technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on
     Earth. To achieve this goal, a quantum network stack should be built from
     the ground up as the physical nature of the communication is fundamentally
     different. The first realisations of quantum networks are imminent, but
     there is no practical proposal for how to organise, utilise, and manage
     such networks. In this memo, we attempt lay down the framework and
     introduce some basic architectural principles for a quantum internet. This
     is intended for general guidance and general interest, but also to provide
     a foundation for discussion between physicists and network
     specialists.</t>

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>Quantum networks are distributed systems of quantum devices that
     utilise fundamental quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition,
     entanglement, and quantum measurement to achieve capabilities beyond what
     is possible with classical networks. Depending on the stage of a quantum
     network <xref target="wehner18"></xref> such devices may be simple
     photonic devices capable of preparing and measuring only one quantum bit
     (qubit) at a time, all the way to large-scale quantum computers of the
     future. A quantum network is not meant to replace classical networks, but
     rather form an overall hybrid classical quantum network supporting new
     capabilities which are otherwise impossible to realise.

     This new networking paradigm offers promise for a range of new
     applications such as secure communications <xref
     target="bennett14"></xref>, distributed quantum computation <xref
     target="crep02"></xref>, or quantum sensor networks <xref
     target="giov04"></xref>. The field of quantum communication has been a
     subject of active research for many years and the most well-known
     application of quantum communication, quantum key distribution (QKD) for
     secure communications, has already been deployed at short (roughly 100km)
     distances.</t>

     <t>Fully quantum networks capable of transmitting and managing entangled
     quantum states in order to send, receive, and manipulate distributed
     quantum information are now imminent <xref target="castel18"></xref> <xref
     target="wehner18"></xref>. Whilst a lot of effort has gone into physically
     realising and connecting such devices, and making improvements to their
     speed and error tolerance there are no worked out proposals for how to run
     these networks. To draw an analogy with a classical network, we are at a
     stage where we can start to physically connect our devices and send data,
     but all sending, receiving, buffer management, connection synchronisation,
     and so on, must be managed by the application itself at what is even lower
     than assembly level where no common interfaces yet exist. Furthermore,
     whilst physical mechanisms for forwarding quantum states exist, there are
     no robust protocols for managing such transmissions.</t>
   </section>

   <section title="Model of communication">
     <t>In order to understand the framework for quantum networking a basic
     understanding of quantum information is necessary. The following sections
     aim to introduce the bare minimum necessary to understand the principles
     of operation of a quantum network. This exposition was written with a
     classical networking audience in mind. It is assumed that the reader has
     never before been exposed to any quantum physics. We refer to e.g. <xref
     target="nielsen"/> for an in-depth introduction to quantum
     information.</t>

     <section title="Qubit">
       <t>The differences between quantum computation and classical computation
       begin at the bit-level. A classical computer operates on the binary
       alphabet { 0, 1 }. A quantum bit, a qubit, exists over the same binary
       space, but unlike the classical bit, it can exist in a so-called
       superposition of the two possibilities:</t>

       <t>a |0> + b |1>,</t>

       <t>where |X> denotes a quantum state, here the binary 0 and 1, and the
       coefficients a and b are complex numbers called probability amplitudes.
       Physically, such a state can be realised using a variety of different
       technologies such as electron spin, photon polarisation, atomic energy
       levels, and so on.</t>

       <t>Upon measurement, the qubit loses its superposition and irreversibly
       collapses into one of the two basis states, either |0> or |1>. Which of
       the two states it ends up in is not deterministic, but it can be
       determined from the readout of the measurement, a classical bit, 0 or 1
       respectively. The probability of measuring the state in the |0> state is
       |a|^2 and similarly the probability of measuring the state in the |1>
       state is |b|^2, where |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1. This randomness is not due to
       our ignorance of the underlying mechanisms, but rather it is a
       fundamental feature of a quantum mechanical system <xref
       target="aspect81"></xref>.</t>

       <t>The superposition property plays an important role in fundamental
       gate operations on qubits. Since a qubit can exist in a superposition of
       its basis states, the elementary quantum gates are able to act on all
       states of the superposition at the same time. For example, consider the
       NOT gate:</t>

       <t>NOT (a |0> + b |1>) -> a |1> + b |0>.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Multiple qubits">
       <t>When multiple qubits are combined in a single quantum state the space
       of possible states grows exponentially and all these states can coexist
       in a superposition. For example, the general form of a two-qubit
       register is</t>

       <t>a |00> + b |01> + c |10> + d |11></t>

       <t>where the coefficients have the same probability amplitude
       interpretation as for the single qubit state. Each state represents a
       possible outcome of a measurement of the two-qubit register. For
       example, |01>, denotes a state in which the first qubit is in the state
       |0> and the second is in the state |1>.</t>

       <t>Performing single qubit gates affects the relevant qubit in each of
       the superposition states. Similarly, two-qubit gates also act on all the
       relevant superposition states, but their outcome is far more
       interesting.</t>

       <t>Consider a two-qubit register where the first qubit is in the
       superposed state (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and the other is in the state |0>.
       This combined state can be written as:</t>

       <t>(|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) x |0> = (|00> + |10>)/sqrt(2),</t>

       <t>where x denotes a tensor product (the mathematical mechanism for
       combining quantum states together). Let us now consider the two-qubit
       CNOT gate. The CNOT gate takes as input two qubits, a control and
       target, and applies the NOT gate to the target if the control qubit is
       set. The truth table looks like</t>

       <texttable>
         <ttcol align="center">IN</ttcol>
         <ttcol align="center">OUT</ttcol>
         <c>00</c><c>00</c>
         <c>01</c><c>01</c>
         <c>10</c><c>11</c>
         <c>11</c><c>10</c>
       </texttable>

       <t>Now, consider performing a CNOT gate on the ensemble with the first
       qubit being the control. We apply a two-qubit gate on all the
       superposition states:</t>

       <t>CNOT (|00> + |10>)/sqrt(2) -> (|00> + |11>)/sqrt(2).</t>

       <t>What is so interesting about this two-qubit gate operation? The final
       state is *entangled*. There is no possible way of representing that
       quantum state as a product of two individual qubits, they are no longer
       independent and their behaviour cannot be fully described without
       accounting for the other qubit. The states of the two individual qubits
       are now correlated beyond what is possible to achieve classically.
       Neither qubit is in a definite |0> or |1> state, but if we perform a
       measurement on either one, the outcome of the partner qubit will
       *always* yield the exact same outcome. The final state, whether it's
       |00> or |11>, is fundamentally random as before, but the states of the
       two qubits following a measurement will always be identical.</t>

       <t>Once a measurement is performed, the two qubits are once again
       independent. The final state is either |00> or |11> and both of these
       states can be trivially decomposed into a product of two individual
       qubits. The entanglement has been consumed and if the same measurement
       is to be repeated, the entangled state must be prepared again.</t>
     </section>
   </section>

   <section title="Entanglement as the fundamental service">

     <t>Entanglement is the fundamental building block of quantum networks. To
     see this, consider the state from the previous section:</t>

     <t>(|00> + |11>)/sqrt(2).</t>

     <t>Neither of the two qubits is in a definite |0> or |1> state and we need
     to know the state of the entire register to be able to fully describe the
     behaviour of the two qubits.</t>

     <t>Entangled qubits have interesting non-local properties. Consider
     sending one of the qubits to another device. This device could in
     principle be anywhere: on the other side of the room, in a different
     country, or even on a different planet. Provided negligible noise has been
     introduced, the two qubits will forever remain in the entangled state
     until a measurement is performed. The physical distance does not matter at
     all for entanglement.</t>

     <t>This lies at the heart of quantum networking, because it is possible to
     leverage the non-classical correlations provided by entanglement in order
     to design completely new types of application protocols that are not
     possible to achieve with just classical communication. Examples of such
     applications are quantum cryptography, blind quantum computation, or
     distributed quantum computation.</t>

     <t>Entanglement has two very special features from which one can derive
     some intuition about the types of applications enabled by a quantum
     network.</t>

     <t>The first stems from the fact that entanglement enables stronger than
     classical correlations, leading to opportunities for tasks that require
     coordination. As a trivial example consider the problem of consensus
     between two nodes who want to agree on the value of a single bit. They can
     use the quantum network to prepare the state (|00> + |11>)/sqrt(2) with
     each node holding one of the two qubits. Once any of the two nodes
     performs a measurement the state of the two qubits collapses to either
     |00> or |11> so whilst the outcome is random and does not exist before
     measurement, the two nodes will always measure the same value. We can also
     build the more general multi-qubit state (|00...> + |11...>)/sqrt(2) and
     perform the same algorithm between an arbitrary number of nodes. These
     stronger than classical correlations generalise to more complicated
     measurement schemes as well.</t>

     <t>The second feature of entanglement is that it cannot be shared, in the
     sense that if two qubits are maximally entangled with each other, than it
     is physically impossible for any other system to have any share of this
     entanglement. Hence, entanglement forms a sort of private and inherently
     untappable connection between two nodes once established.</t>

     <t>It is impossible to entangle two qubits without ever having them
     directly interact with each other (e.g. by performing a local two-qubit
     gate, such as the CNOT). A local - or mediated - interaction is necessary
     to create entanglement and thus such states cannot be created between two
     quantum nodes that cannot transmit quantum states to each other.
     Therefore, it is the transmission of qubits that draws the line between a
     genuine quantum network and a collection of quantum computers connected
     over a classical network.</t>

     <t>A quantum network is defined as a collection of nodes that is able to
     exchange qubits and distribute entangled states amongst themselves. A
     quantum node that is able only to communicate classically with another
     quantum node is not a member of a quantum network.</t>

     <t>More complex services and applications can be built on top of entangled
     states distributed by the network, see e.g. <xref
     target="wehner18"></xref>></t>
   </section>

   <section title="Achieving quantum connectivity">

     <t>This section explains the meaning of quantum connectivity and the
     necessary physical processes at an abstract level.</t>

     <section title="Challenges">

       <t>A quantum network cannot be built by simply extrapolating all the
       classical models to their quantum analogues. One cannot just send qubits
       like one can send bits over a wire. There are several technological as
       well as fundamental challenges that make classical approaches unsuitable
       in a quantum context.</t>

       <section title="The measurement problem">

         <t>In classical computers and networks we can read out the bits stored
         in memory at any time. This is helpful for a variety of purposes such
         as copying, error detection and correction, and so on. This is not
         possible with qubits.</t>

         <t>A measurement of a qubit's state will destroy its superposition and
         with it any entanglement it may have been part of. Once a qubit is
         being processed, it cannot be read out until a suitable point in the
         computation, determined by the protocol handling the qubit, has been
         reached. Therefore, we cannot use the same methods known from
         classical computing for the purposes of error detection and
         correction.</t>

       </section>

       <section title="No-cloning theorem">

         <t>Since directly reading the state of a qubit is not possible, one could
         ask the question if we can simply copy a qubit without looking at it.
         Unfortunately, this is fundamentally not possible in quantum
         mechanics.</t>

         <t>The no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an
         identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state. Therefore, it is
         also impossible to use the same mechanisms that worked for classical
         networks for signal amplification, retransmission, and so on as they
         all rely on the ability to copy the underlying data. Since any
         physical channel will always be lossy, connecting nodes within a
         quantum network is a challenging endeavour and its architecture must
         at its core address this very issue.</t>

       </section>

       <section title="Fidelity">

         <t>In general, it is expected that a classical packet arrives at its
         destination without any errors introduced by hardware noise along the
         way. This is verified at various levels through a variety of
         checksums. Since we cannot read or copy a quantum state a similar
         approach is out of question for quantum networks.</t>

         <t>To describe the quality of a quantum state a physical quantity called
         fidelity is used. Fidelity takes a value between 0 and 1 -- higher is
         better, and less than 0.5 means the state is unusable. It measures how
         close a quantum state is to the state we desire it to be in. It
         expresses the probability that one state will pass a test to identify
         as the other. Fidelity is an important property of a quantum system
         that allows us to quantify how much a particular state has been
         affected by noise from various sources (gate errors, channel losses,
         environment noise).</t>

         <t>Interestingly, quantum applications do not need perfect fidelity to be
         able to execute -- as long as it is above some application-specific
         threshold, they will simply operate at lower rates. Therefore, rather
         than trying to ensure that we always deliver perfect states (a
         technologically challenging task) applications will specify a minimum
         threshold for the fidelity and the network will try its best to
         deliver it.</t>

       </section>

     </section>

     <section title="Bell pairs">

       <t>Conceptually, the most straightforward way to distribute an entangled
       state is to simply transmit one of the qubits directly to the other end
       across a series of nodes while performing sufficient forward quantum
       error correction to bring losses down to an acceptable level. Despite
       the no-cloning theorem and the inability to directly measure a quantum
       state error-correcting mechanisms for quantum communication exist <xref
       target="mural14"></xref>. However, quantum error correction makes very
       high demands on both resources (physical qubits needed) and their
       initial fidelity. Implementation is very challenging and quantum error
       correction is not expected to be used until later generations of quantum
       networks.</t>

       <t>An alternative relies on the observation that we do not need to be able
       to distribute any arbitrary entangled quantum state. We only need to be
       able to distribute any one of what are known as the Bell pair states.
       Bell pair states are the entangled two-qubit states:</t>

       <t>
         |00> + |11>,<vspace blankLines="0" />
         |00> - |11>,<vspace blankLines="0" />
         |01> + |10>,<vspace blankLines="0" />
         |01> - |10>,
       </t>

       <t>where the constant 1/sqrt(2) normalisation factor has been ignored for
       clarity. Any of the four Bell pair state above will do as it is possible
       to transform any Bell pair into another Bell pair with local operations
       performed on only one of the qubits. That is, either of the nodes that
       hold the two qubits of the Bell pair can apply a series of single qubit
       gates to just their qubit in order to transform the ensemble between the
       different variants.</t>

       <t>Distributing a Bell pair between two nodes is much easier than
       transmitting an arbitrary quantum state over a network. Since the state
       is known handling errors becomes easier and small-scale error-correction
       (such as entanglement distillation discussed in a later section)
       combined with reattempts becomes a valid strategy.</t>
	     
       <t>Bell pairs are also the basic fundamental unit for building complex 
       multi-partite entanglement state shared among several nodes of the network.
       This opens the way for distributed applications based on multi-party quantum 
       communication such as secret voting and secret sharing, conference key agreement,
       clock synchronization, or distributed quantum computation.</t>

       <t>The reason for using Bell pairs specifically as opposed to any other
       two-qubit state, is that they are the maximally entangled two-qubit set
       of basis states. Maximal entanglement means that these states have the
       strongest non-classical correlations of all possible two-qubit states.
       Furthermore, since single-qubit local operations can never increase
       entanglement, less entangled states would impose some constraints on
       distributed quantum algorithms. This makes Bell pairs particularly
       useful as a generic building block for distributed quantum
       applications.</t>

     </section>

     <section title="Teleportation">

       <t>The observation that we only need to be able to distribute Bell pairs
       relies on the fact that this enables the distribution of any other
       arbitrary entangled state. This can be achieved via quantum state
       teleportation. Quantum state teleportation consumes an unknown quantum
       state that we want to transmit and recreates it at the desired
       destination. This does not violate the no-cloning theorem as the
       original state is destroyed in the process.</t>

       <t>To achieve this, an entangled pair needs to be distributed between the
       source and destination before teleportation commences. The source then
       entangles the transmission qubit with its end of the pair and performs a
       read out on the two qubits (the sum of these operations is called a Bell
       state measurement). This consumes the Bell pair's entanglement turning
       the source and destination qubits into independent states. The
       measurements yields two classical bits which the source sends to the
       destination over a classical channel. Based on the value of the received
       two classical bits, the destination performs one of four possible
       corrections (called the Pauli corrections) on its end of the pair which
       turns it into the unknown quantum state that we wanted to transmit.</t>

       <t>The unknown quantum state that was transmitted never entered the network
       itself. Therefore, the network needs to only be able to reliably produce
       Bell pairs between any two nodes in the network.</t>

     <section title="The life cycle of entanglement">

       <t>Reducing the problem of quantum connectivity to one of generating a Bell
       pair has facilitated the problem, but it has not solved it. In this
       section we discuss, how these entangled pairs are generated in the first
       place, and how its two qubits are delivered to the end-points.</t>

       <section title="Link generation">

       </section>

       <section title="Entanglement swapping">

         <t>The problem with generating entangled pairs directly across a link is
         that its efficiency decreases with its length. Beyond a few 10s of kms
         the rate is effectively zero and due to the no-cloning theorem we
         cannot simply amplify the signal. The solution is entanglement
         swapping.</t>

         <t>A Bell pair between any two nodes in the network can be constructed by
         combining the pairs generated along each individual link on the path
         between the two end-points. Each node along the path can consume the
         two pairs on the two links that it is connected to in order to produce
         a new entangled Pair between the two remote ends. This process is
         known as entanglement swapping. Pictorially it can be represented as
         follows:</t>

         <figure align="center">
           <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[

         </figure>

         <t>where X1 and X2 are the qubits of the entangled pair X and Y1 and
         Y2 are the qubits of entangled pair Y. The entanglement is denoted
         with ~~. In the diagram above nodes A and B share the pair X and nodes
         B and C share the pair Y, but we want entanglement between A and
         C.</t>

         <t>To achieve this goal we simply teleport the qubit X2 using the pair Y.
         This requires node B to performs a Bell state measurement on the
         qubits X2 and Y1 which result in the destruction of the entanglement
         between Y1 and Y2. However, X2 is transmitted and recreated in Y2's
         place carrying with it its entanglement with X1. The end-result is
         shown below:</t>

         <t>Depending on the needs of the network and/or application a final Pauli
         correction at the recipient node may not be necessary since the result
         of this operation is also a Bell pair. However, the two classical bits
         that form the read out from the measurement at node B must still be
         communicated, because they carry information about which of the four
         Bell pairs was actually produced. If a correction is not performed,
         the recipient must be informed which Bell pair was received.</t>

         <t>This process of teleporting Bell pairs using other entangled pairs is
         called entanglement swapping.</t>

         <section title="Distillation">

           <t>Neither the generation of Bell pairs nor the swapping operations are
           noiseless operations. Therefore, with each link and each swap the
           fidelity of the state degrades. However, it is possible to create
           higher fidelity Bell pair states from two or more lower fidelity
           pairs through a process called distillation or purification.</t>

           <t>To purify a quantum state, a second (and sometimes third) quantum
           state is used as a "test tool" to test a proposition about the first
           state, e.g., "the parity of the first state is even." When the test
           succeeds, confidence in the state is improved, and thus the fidelity
           is improved. The test tool states are destroyed in the process, so
           resource demands increase substantially when distillation is used.
           When the test fails, the tested state must also be discarded.
           Purification makes low demands on fidelity and resources, but
           distributed protocols incur round-trip delays <xref

       <section title="Direct transmission vs. entanglement swapping">

         <t>Direct state transmission whilst simpler conceptually is much more
         demanding to implement reliably in practice which means that any
         near-term practical realisation is more likely to succeed if it is
         based on the Bell pair and entanglement swapping architecture. All
         near-term experimental implementations of quantum repeaters are based
         on this approach. Therefore, this is the architecture that we will
         focus on in the rest of this memo.</t>

         <t>Nevertheless, the direct transmission proposal may be relevant in the
         future as it has better fault-tolerance properties and much better
         scaling with transmission distance. It might even be beneficial to
         utilise a hybrid approach that combines the fault-tolerance of direct
         transmission with the generic nature of Bell pairs which lends itself
         to paralellisation and resource provisioning. That is, we still use
         Bell pairs for transmission of user data, but direct transmission may
         be used for some of hops for the purposes of Bell pair generation
         rather than just relying solely on entanglement swapping.</t>

   <section title="Architecture of a quantum internet">

     <t>It is evident from the previous sections that the fundamental service
     provided by a quantum network significantly differs from that of a
     classical network. Therefore, it is not surprising that the architecture
     of a quantum internet will itself be very different from that of the
     classical Internet.</t>

     <section title="New challenges">

       <t>This subsection covers the major fundamental challenges building quantum
       networks. Here, we only describe the fundamental differences,
       technological limitations are described later.</t>

       <t>
         <list style="numbers">
           <t>There is no quantum equivalent of a payload carrying packet.
           <vspace blankLines="1" />

           In most classical networks, including Ethernet, Internet Protocol
           (IP), and Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks, user data
           is grouped into packets. In addition to the user data each packet
           also contains a series of headers which contain the control
           information that lets routers and switches forward it towards its
           destination. Packets are the fundamental unit in a classical
           network.
           <vspace blankLines="1" />

           In a quantum network the entangled pairs of qubits are the basic
           unit of networking. These pairs are handled individually -- they are
           not grouped into packets and they do not carry any headers.
           Therefore, quantum networks will have to send all control
           information via separate classical channels which the repeaters will
           have to correlate with the qubits stored in their memory or to send all control information by using dense coding 
	   which send classical bit on the same quantum network. The control plan will be a quantum application that consume 
	   bell pair to send quantum control plane.</t>

           <t>An entangled pair is only useful if the locations of both qubits
           are known.
           <vspace blankLines="1" />

           A classical network packet logically exists only at one location at
           any point in time. If a packet is modified in some way, headers or
           payload, this information does not need to be conveyed to anybody
           else in the network. The packet can be simply forwarded as before.
           <vspace blankLines="1" />

           In contrast, entanglement is a phenomenon in which two or more
           qubits exist in a physically distributed state. Operations on one of
           the qubits change the mutual state of the pair. Since the owner of a
           particular qubit cannot just read out its state, it must coordinate
           all its actions with the owner of the pair's other qubit. Therefore,
           the owner of any qubit that is part of an entangled pair must know
           the location of its counterpart. Location, in this context, need not
           be the explicit spatial location. A relevant pair identifier, a
           means of communication between the pair owners, and an association
           between the pair ID and the individual qubits is sufficient.</t>

           <t>Generating entanglement requires temporary state.
           <vspace blankLines="1" />

           Packet forwarding in a classical network is largely a stateless
           operation. When a packet is received, the router looks up its
           forwarding table and sends the packet out of the appropriate output.
           There is no need to keep any memory of the packet any more.
           <vspace blankLines="1" />

           A quantum repeater must be able to make decisions about qubits that
           it receives and is holding in its memory. Since qubits do not carry
           headers, the receipt of an entangled pair conveys no control
           information based on which the repeater can make a decision. The
           relevant control information will arrive separately over a classical
           channel. This implies that a repeater must store temporary state as
           the control information and the qubit it pertains to will, in
           general, not arrive at the same time.</t>

           <t>Generating end-to-end entanglement is a parallelisable operation.
           <vspace blankLines="1" />

           Classical packets carry user data from source destination by
           performing a series of hops across the network. This process is
           necessarily sequential -- it is impossible to forward a packet ahead
           of time as the user data it carries cannot be known in advance.

           A quantum network does not carry any user data. It is only
           responsible for generating entangled pairs in any of the generic
           Bell states. The process of creating an end-to-end Bell pair is by
           its nature parallelisable -- all of the individual link pairs can be
           generated independently of one another. Furthermore, there is no
           ordering requirement on the entanglement swapping operations either,
           they can happen in any order as long as the network can keep track
           of which pairs were swapped so that it can correctly identify the
           two ends of the final Bell pair. This parallelism must be exploited
           to make the most efficient use of the quantum network's
           resources.</t>

     <section title="Classical communication">

       <t>In this memo we have already covered two different roles that classical
       communication must perform:</t>

       <t>
         <list style="symbols">

           <t>communicate classical bits of information as part of distributed
           protocols such as entanglement swapping and teleportation,</t>

           <t>communicate control information within a network - this includes
           both background protocols such as routing as well as signalling
           protocols to set up end-to-end entanglement generation.</t>

         </list>
       </t>

       <t>Classical communication is a crucial building block of any quantum
       network. All nodes in a quantum network are assumed to have classical
       connectivity with each other (within typical administrative domain
       limts). Therefore, quantum routers will need to manage two data planes
       in parallel, a classical one and a quantum one. Additionally, it must be
       able to correlate information between them so that the control
       information received on a classical channel can be applied to the qubits
       managed by the quantum data plane.</t>

     <section title="Abstract model of the network">

       <section title="Elements of a quantum network">

         <t>Collecting all the pieces described so far, a quantum network will
         consist of the following elements:</t>

         <t>
           <list style="symbols">

             <t>Quantum repeaters - A quantum repeater is a node in the network
             that is capable of generating entangled pairs with its directly
             connected neighbours and performing entanglement swap operations
             on them.</t>

             <t>Quantum routers - A quantum router is a quantum repeater that is
             connected to more than two quantum repeaters as neighbours. This
             distinguishes it from quantum repeaters composed into a linear
             chain to connect two quantum routers (since no-cloning prohibits
             quantum signal amplification).</t>

             <t>End-nodes - End-nodes in a quantum network must be able to receive
             and handle an entangled pair, but they do not need to be able to
             perform an entanglement swap (and thus are not necessarily quantum
             repeaters). End-nodes are also not required to have any quantum
             memory as certain quantum applications can be realised by having
             the end-node measure its qubit as soon as it is received.</t>

             <t>Non-quantum nodes - Not all nodes in a quantum network need to
             have a quantum data plane. A non-quantum node is any device that
             can handle classical network traffic.</t>

             <t>Quantum links - A quantum link is a link which can be used to
             generate an entangled pair between two directly connected quantum
             repeaters and thus may include a source of bell pair. 
	     It may include a dedicated classical channel that is to
             be used solely for the purpose of coordinating the entanglement
             generation on this quantum link.</t>

             <t>Classical links - A classical link is a physical or logical (e.g dense coding) link between any node
             in the network that is capable of carrying classical network
             traffic.</t>

         <t>An application running on two end-nodes attached to a network will at
         some point need the network to generate entangled pairs for its use.
         This will require negotiation between the end-nodes, because they must
         both open a communication end-point (a quantum socket) which the
         network can use to identify the two ends of the connection. The two
         end-nodes use the classical connectivity available in the network to
         achieve this goal.</t>

         <t>When the network receives a request to generate end-to-end entangled
         pairs it uses the classical communication channels to coordinate and
         claim the resources necessary to fulfil this request. This may be some
         combination of prior control information (e.g. routing tables) and
         signalling protocols, but the details of how this is achieved are an
         active research question and thus beyond the scope of this memo.</t>

         <t>During or after the control information is distributed the network
         performs the necessary quantum operations such as generating entangled
         over individual links, performing entanglement swaps, and further
         signalling to transmit the swap outcomes and other control
         information. Since none of the entangled pairs carry any user data,
         some of these operations can be performed before the request is
         received in anticipation of the demand.</t>

         <t>The entangled pair is delivered to the application once it is ready,
         together with the relevant pair identifier. However, being ready does
         not necessarily mean once all link pairs and entanglement swaps are
         complete as some applications can start executing on an incomplete
         pair. In this case the remaining entanglement swaps will propagate the
         actions across the network to the other end.</t>

     </section>

     <section title="Network boundaries">

       <t>Just like classical network, there will various boundaries will exist in
       quantum networks.</t>

       <section title="Boundaries between different physical architectures">

         <t>There are many different physical architectures for implementing
         quantum repeater technology. The different technologies differ in how
         they store and manipulate qubits in memory and how they generate
         entanglement across a link with their neighbours. Different
         architectures come with different trade-offs and thus a functional
         network will likely consist of a mixture of different types of quantum
         repeaters.</t>

         <t>For example, architectures based on optical elements and atomic
         ensembles are very efficient at generating entanglement, but provide
         little control over the qubits once the pair is generated. On the
         other hand nitrogen-vacancy architectures offer a much greater degree
         of control over qubits, but have a harder time generating the
         entanglement across a link.</t>

         <t>It is an open research question where exactly the boundary will lie.
         It could be that a single quantum repeater node provides some
         backplane connection between the architectures, but it also could be
         that special quantum links delineate the boundary.</t>

       </section>

       <section title="Boundaries between different administrative regions">

         <t>Just like in classical networks, multiple quantum networks will
         connect into a global quantum internet. This necessarily implies the
         existence of borders between different administrative regions and to define 
	 an inter-autonomous system interconnection protocol to distributing quantum entanglement. 
	 How these boundaries will be handled is also an open question and thus
         beyond the scope of this memo.</t>

       </section>

     </section>

     <section title="Physical constraints">
       <t>The model above has effectively abstracted away the particulars of
       the hardware implementation. However, certain physical constraints need
       to be considered in order to build a practical network. Some of these
       are fundamental constraints and no matter how much the technology
       improves, they will always need to be addressed. Others are artefacts of
       the early stages of a new technology. We here consider a highly abstract
       scenario and refer to <xref target="wehner18"/> for pointers to the
       physics literature.</t>

       <section title="Memory lifetimes">
         <t>In addition to discrete operations being imperfect, storing a qubit
         in memory is also highly non-trivial. The main difficulty in achieving
         persistent storage is that it is extremely challenging to isolate a
         quantum system from the environment. The environment introduces an
         uncontrollable source of noise into the system which affects the
         fidelity of the state. This process is known as decoherence.
         Eventually, the state has to be discarded once its fidelity degrades
         too much.</t>

         <t>The memory lifetime depends on the particular physical setup, but
         the highest achievable values currently are on the order of seconds.
         These values have increased tremendously over the lifetime of the
         different technologies and are bound to keep increasing. However, if
         quantum networks are to be realised in the near future, they need to
         be able to handle short memory lifetimes. An architecture that handles
         short lifetimes may also be more cost-efficient in the future.</t>

       <section title="Rates">
         <t>Entanglement generation on a link between two connected nodes is
         not a very efficient process and it requires many attempts to succeed.
         A fast repetition rate for Bell Pair generation is achievable, but
         only one in a few thousands will succeed. Currently, the highest
         achievable rates of success between nodes capable of storing the
         resulting qubits are of the order of 10 Hz. Combined with short memory
         lifetimes this leads to very tight timing windows to build up
         network-wide connectivity. Achievable rates are likely to increase
         with time, but just like with quantum memories, it may be more
         cost-efficient in the future to provide low-rate links in some parts
         of the network.</t>
       </section>

       <section title="Communication qubit">
         <t>Most physical architectures capable of storing qubits are only able
         to generate entanglement using only a subset of its available qubits
         called communication qubits. Once a Bell Pair has been generated using
         a communication qubit, its state can be transferred into memory. This
         may impose additional limitations on the network. In particular if a
         given node has only one communication qubit it cannot simultaneously
         generate Bell Pairs over two links. It must generate entanglement over
         the links one at a time.</t>

       <section title="Homogeneity">
         <t>Currently all hardware implementations are homogeneous and they do
         not interface with each other. In general, it is very challenging to
         combine different quantum information processing technologies at
         present. Coupling different technologies with each other is of great
         interest as it may help overcome the weaknesses of the different
         implementations, but this may take a long time to be realised with
         high reliability and thus is not a near-term goal.</t>

       <t>Given that the most practical way of realising quantum network
       connectivity is using Bell Pair and entanglement swapping repeater
       technology what sort of principles should guide us in assembling such

       importantly: they work. Furthermore, how do we design networks so that
       they work under the constraints imposed by the hardware available today,
       but do not impose unnecessary burden on future technology. Redeploying
       network technology is a non-trivial process.</t>

       <t>As this is a completely new technology that is likely to see many
       iterations over its lifetime, this memo must not serve as a definitive
       set of rules, but merely as a general set of recommended guidelines
       based on principles and observations made by the community. The benefit
       of having a community built document at this early stage is that
       expertise in both quantum information and network architecture is needed
       in order to successfully build a quantum internet.</t>

       <section title="Goals of a quantum internet">
         <t>When outlining any set of principles we must ask ourselves what
         goals do we want to achieve as inevitably trade-offs must be made. So
         what sort of goals should drive a quantum network architecture? The
         following list has been inspired by the history of the classical
         Internet, but it will inevitably evolve with time and the needs of its
         users. The goals are listed in order of priority which in itself may
         also evolve as the community learns more about the technology.</t>

           <list style="numbers">
             <t>Support distributed quantum applications
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             The primary purpose of a quantum internet is to run distributed
             quantum protocols and it is of utmost importance that they can run
             well and efficiently. Therefore, the needs of quantum applications
             should always be considered first. The requirements for different
             applications can be found in <xref target="wehner18"></xref>.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             If a network is able to distribute entanglement it is officially
             quantum. However, if it is unable to distribute these states with
             a sufficiently high fidelity at a reasonable rate for a majority
             of potential applications it is not practical.</t>

             <t>Support tomorrow's distributed quantum applications
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             There are many applications already proposed to run over a quantum
             internet. However, more algorithms will be invented as the
             community grows as well as the robustness and the reliability of
             the technology. Any proposed architecture should not constrain the
             capabilities of the network for short-term benefit.</t>

             <t>Hardware heterogeneity
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             There are multiple proposals for realising practical quantum
             repeaters and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. It
             is also very likely that the most optimal technologies in the
             future will be hybrid combinations of the many different solutions
             currently under development. It should be an explicit goal of the
             architecture to allow for a large variety of hardware
             implementations.</t>

             <t>Encoding  diversity
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             There are several possible types of encoding, such as continuous variables (e.g quadrature of light, time-energy, etc.)
	     or/and discrete variables (polarization of light, time-bin, etc.), which can be used for entanglement of Bell pairs.
             Each of them has advantages and disadvantages. Continuous variables (CV) can benefit from unconditional operations, 
	     high detection efficiencies, unambiguous state discrimination, and more practical interfacing with conventional
	     information technology. However, they suffer from strong sensitivity to losses and intrinsically limited fidelities.
	     On the other hand, Discret Variable (DV) approaches can achieve fidelity close to unity, but usually at the expense 
	     of probabilistic implementations. Combining the two in hybrid architectures is possible [12].
	     in fact,  "Qubits" can be based on discrete variables or by exploiting symmetries can be based on continuous variables 
	     (e.g  encoded into coherent states, where two phase-opposite coherent states are used for the qubits. 
	     This digital encoding is different from the analog encoding representing Qmodes).  
	     It should be an explicit goal  that Quantum Internet must be compatible with the different methods 
	     of encoding quantum information.</t>

		   
             <t>Be flexible with regards to hardware capabilities and
             limitations
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             This goal encompasses two important points. First, the
             architecture should be able to function under the physical
             constraints imposed by the current generation hardware. Second, it
             should not make it difficult to run the network over any hardware
             that may come along in the future. The physical capabilities of
             repeaters will improve and redeploying a technology is extremely
             challenging.</t>

             <t>Security
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Whilst the priority for the first quantum networks should be to
             simply work, we cannot forget that ultimately they have to also be
             secure. This has implications for the physical realisations (do
             they satisfy the idealised theoretical models) and also the design
             of the control stack.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             It is actually difficult to guarantee security at the network
             level and even if the network did provide such guarantees, the
             application would still need to perform its own verification
             similarly to how one ensures end-to-end security in classical
             networks.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             It turns out that as long as the underlying implementation
             corresponds to (or sufficiently approximates) theoretical models
             of quantum cryptography, quantum cryptographic protocols do not
             need the network to provide any guarantees about the authenticity,
             confidentiality, or integrity of the transmitted qubits or the
             generated entanglement. Instead, applications such as QKD
             establish such guarantees using the classical network in
             conjunction with he quantum one. This is much easier than
             demanding that the network deliver secure entanglement, which
             indeed is not needed for quantum applications.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Nevertheless, control protocols themselves should be security
             aware in order to protect the operation of the network itself and
             limit disruption.</t>

             <t>Availability and resilience
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             A practical and usable network is able to continue to operate
             despite losses and failures, and will be robust to malicious
             actors trying to disable connectivity. These may be simply
             considered different aspects of security, but it is worthwhile to
             address them explicitly at the architectural level already.</t>

             <t>Easy to manage and monitor
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Quantum networks rely on complex physical phenomena and require
             hardware that is challenging to build. Furthermore, the quantum
             resources will at first be very scarce and potentially very
             expensive. This entails a need for a robust management solution.
             It is important that a good management solution needs to come with
             adequate monitoring capabilities.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Good management solutions may also be key to optimising the
             networks which in turn may be crucial in making them economically
             feasible. Unlike user data that is transmitted over classical
             networks, quantum networks only need to generate generic Bell
             Pairs. This leaves a lot of room for pre-allocating resources in
             an efficient manner.</t>

       <section title="The principles of a quantum internet">

         <t>The principles support the goals, but are not goals themselves. The
         goals define what we want to build and the principles provide a
         guideline in how we might achieve this. The goals will also be the
         foundation for defining any metric of success for a network
         architecture, whereas the principles in themselves do not distinguish
         between success and failure. For more information about design
         considerations for quantum networks see <xref target="meter13"></xref>
         <xref target="dahlberg18"></xref> .</t>

         <t>
           <list style="numbers">
             <t>Bell Pairs are the fundamental building block
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             The key service that a quantum network provides is the
             distribution of entanglement between the nodes in a network. This
             point additionally specifies that the entanglement is primarily
             distributed in the form of the entangled Bell Pair states which
             should be used as a building block in providing other services,
             including more complex entangled states.</t>

             <t>Fidelity is part of the service
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             In addition to being able to deliver Bell Pairs to the
             communication end-points, the Bell Pairs must be of sufficient
             fidelity. Unlike in classical networks where errors should
             essentially be eliminated for most application protocols, many
             quantum applications only need imperfect entanglement to function.
             However, different applications will have different requirements
             for what fidelity they can work with. It is the network's
             responsibility to balance the resource usage with respect to the
             application's requirements. It may be that it is cheaper for the
             network to provide lower fidelity pairs that are just above the
             threshold required by the application than it is to guarantee high
             fidelity pairs to all applications regardless of their
             requirements.</t>

             <t>Bell Pairs are indistinguishable
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Any two Bell Pairs between the same two nodes are
             indistinguishable for the purposes of an application provided they
             both satisfy its required fidelity threshold. This point is
             crucial in enabling the reuse of resources of a network and for
             the purposes of provisioning resources to meet application demand.
             However, the qubits that make up the pair themselves are not
             indistinguishable and the two nodes operating on a pair must
             coordinate to make sure they are operating on qubits that belong
             to the same Bell Pair.</t>

             <t>Time as an expensive resource
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             With the current technology, time is the most expensive resource.
             It is not the only resource that is in short supply (memory, and
             communication qubits are as well), but ultimately it is the
             lifetime of quantum memories that imposes the most difficult
             conditions for operating an extended network of quantum nodes.
             Current hardware has low rates of Bell Pair generation, short
             memory lifetimes, and access to a limited number of communication
             qubits. All these factors combined mean that even a short waiting
             queue at some node could be enough for the Bell Pairs to decohere.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             However, time is only expensive once quantum operations are
             underway. If no quantum operations are currently being processed
             then the network can use this time to prepare and provision
             resources.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             As hardware improves, the need for carefully timing quantum
             operations may become smaller. It is currently unknown what the
             cost of these improvements will be, but it is conceivable that
             there is value in having relatively cheap and undemanding links
             connected at the edges of a network which will have very short
             memory lifetimes and low rates of Bell Pair generation.</t>

             <t>Limit classical communication
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             This point offers a practical guideline to the issue of timing. A
             bottleneck in many quantum networked algorithms is the classical
             communication needed between quantum operations to synchronise
             state. Ideally, classical control mechanisms that require
             increased memory lifetimes should be avoided.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             For example, some quantum protocols may need to perform a
             correction for the random outcome of a quantum measurement. For
             this, they will block the state from further operations until a
             classical message is received with the information necessary to
             perform the correction. The time during which the quantum state is
             blocked is effectively wasted. It reduces the time available for
             subsequent operations possibly rendering the state useless for an
             application.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Trade-offs that allow a protocol to limit the number of blocking
             classical communication rounds once quantum operations have
             commenced will in general be worth considering.</t>

             <t>Parallelise quantum operations
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             A further point to address the issue of timing constraints in the
             network. The Bell Pairs on the individual links need not be
             generated one after another along the path between the
             communication end-points. The order does not matter at all.
             Furthermore, the order of the swap operations is flexible as long
             as they don't reduce the fidelity too much. Parallelising these
             operations is key to optimising quantum protocols.</t>

             <t>Avoid time-based coordination when possible
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             A solution to timing constraints is to synchronise clocks and
             agree on the timing of events. However, such solutions have
             several downsides. Whilst network clock synchronisation may be
             accurate enough for certain purposes it introduces an additional
             element of complexity, especially when multiple nodes in different
             networks must be synchronised. Furthermore, clock synchronisation
             will never be perfect and it is conceivable that hardware
             capabilities advance so much that time-based mechanisms
             under-utilise resources in the more efficient parts of the
             network.
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Nevertheless, it may not be possible to avoid clocks, but such
             solutions should be adequately justified.</t>

             <t>Pre-allocate resources
             <vspace blankLines="1" />

             Regardless of what application is running over the network it will
             have the same needs as any other application: a number of Bell
             Pairs of sufficient fidelity. Whilst the fidelity is a variable
             number, the indistinguishability of Bell Pairs means that there is
             lots of flexibility in how a network may provision resources to
             meet demand. The additional timing constraints mean that
             pre-allocation of resources will be central to a usable quantum
             network.</t>
